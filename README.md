## Libraries Used

Folder name `emojis` contain images of emoji, so when you click on `add data` after running the project make sure that name of emoji image file in emojis folder name and the name you input in terminal are same, so that it can match for display purpose.
After that program will take 100 images which will be considered as data for the name which you selected so input you face accordingly, for example if emojis image is anngry then you have to input the name as angry and also make your face as angry during data collection.
After all the data you input, just once click `train` data from the interface you have.
Then we are good to go just click on `run`
